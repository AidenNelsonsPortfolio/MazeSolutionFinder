# MazeSolutionFinder
Takes a built maze file and can find the best path through the maze, using a recursive algorithm, displaying results visually!

Select anywhere in the maze (as long as it is not a blue wall) to start the pathfinding, and watch as the algorithm recursively traces its steps through the maze.

Set to a timer delay, the actual path is solved nearly instantly with the help of some of Java's inbuilt data strutures, like Linked Lists / Array Lists to keep track of consecutive actions by the algorithm.

You have the ability to re-load the maze, or to generate an entirely new maze from a different provided file.

The above is the new default maze for startup, and it is really quite impressive. 

Here is an example of the algorithm trying to find its way through the maze:

The green path is where it has found to go, and the red is where the algorithm has tried to go, and has either failed or been impossible to continue from.

Try out some of the provided mazes to see the algorithm do its thing!

Enjoy!
