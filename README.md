# MazeSolutionFinder
Takes a built maze file and can find the best path through the maze, using a recursive algorithm, displaying results visually!

Select anywhere in the maze (as long as it is not a blue wall) to start the pathfinding, and watch as the algorithm recursively traces its steps through the maze.

Set to a timer delay, the actual path is solved nearly instantly with the help of some of Java's inbuilt data strutures, like Linked Lists / Array Lists to keep track of consecutive actions by the algorithm.

Try out some of the provided mazes to see the algorithm do its thing!

Enjoy!
